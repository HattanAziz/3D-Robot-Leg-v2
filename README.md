# 3D-Robot-Leg-v2
# This is not my specialty, but I wanted to learn Mechanical Engineering and design 3D design

Design the legs of a three-dimensional robot with a height of 64 cm , In the course of mechanical engineering

I used CINEMA 4D to design the Robot Leg If you don't know how to design Just search in youtube

# The first step in designing a leg is the foot or the (shoe)

# The second step is to design a base for fixing the foot

# The third step is to design the knee or a joint to fix the lower side

# The fourth step is to establish a base for me to stabilize everything below and balance
# The fifth step is to design for the second time the knee and design with the same sizes

# The sixth step, the easiest step, is to copy the entire figure and place it next to the first leg, and it will be of the same sizes and proximity

# Finally, design the fixed part on top of the design
